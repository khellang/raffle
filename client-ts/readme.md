# Generate Services

## Build generator

Use terminal

- Open generator

```
npm install

npm build
```

## In client-ts

To generate new client-services, the api has to run (expect it to run on http://localhost:5000).

To adjust where the swagger-file should be read from, please make the changes in client-ts/generate.js

```
npm run generate-services
```
